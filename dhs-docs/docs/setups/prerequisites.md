## 🔑 Configure Password-less SSH

Hadoop requires SSH access to manage its nodes.  
_(Make sure you can SSH to localhost in Ubuntu; this is critical and must follow this step)_

Run the following command to test SSH connection:

````bash
ssh localhost

Now, If you encounter the error "ssh: connect to host localhost port 22: Connection refused", run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt remove openssh-server
sudo apt install openssh-server
sudo service ssh start
````

If you cannot ssh to localhost without a passphrase, run the following command to initialize your private and public keys.

🔐 Generating SSH Keys (if required)

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -P '' -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Now `ssh localhost` should work without requiring a passphrase.
(Tip: Always backup your keys if you plan to regenerate them!)

## 🧰 Install Java

Hadoop requires JAVA to work so we'll proceed with JAVA installation

Update the package index:

```bash
sudo apt update

# check java version
java -version

#If Java isn't installed, install Java 8 from OpenJDK via the following command:
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
java -version

# you'll see output like this
openjdk version "1.8.0_442"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_442-8u442-b06~us1-0ubuntu1~22.04-b06)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.442-b06, mixed mode)
```

## 🗺️ Configure `/etc/hosts` with your Private IP

This ensures correct address resolution for all running daemons.
📌 Important: Update this entry whenever your EC2 private IP address changes.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts

# Replace with your EC2 private IP
172.31.47.110  ip-172-31-47-110
```

## 🔧 Set nice Value Limits for your user

This setting allows Hadoop to change the priority of its daemons at runtime. Update it to match your username, as the current configuration is set for the user `ubuntu`.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/security/limits.conf

ubuntu  soft  nice  -20
ubuntu  hard  nice  -20
```

### 🔍 Verify updated limit

**Note:** This will take effect after reboot.

```bash
ulimit -e
# should show 20
```

## 🧰 Summary of Prerequisites

- Java 8 OpenJDK
- SSH configured between nodes
- Proper user permissions and folders created (check using `stat path/to/folder`)
  - Full rwx permission for the intended user is required
- added `/etc/hosts` for correct address resolution
- changed `nice` value of current user

Proceed to Hadoop installation only after completing these steps. 😎👍
